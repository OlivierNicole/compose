The objective with this repo is to reimplement some of David Copeâ€™s work on
automated music generation. However, so far, it consists only in taking a bit of
the code of [Llama](https://github.com/gridbugs/llama) to parse MIDI
files, some code to write those files, and some to convert MIDI events to a
format of events that are more convenient for me.
