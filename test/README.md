The objective with this repo is to reimplement some of David Copeâ€™s work on
automated music generation. However, so far, it consists only in trying to use
the [Mm](https://ocaml.org/p/mm/latest) OCaml library to parse and write MIDI
files, and convert MIDI events to a format of events that are more convenient
for me.

Mm does not work very well to write valid MIDI files so far so this is a WIP.
